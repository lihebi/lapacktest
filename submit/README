=ENVIRONMENT=
Run under matlab r2011b(7.13.0.564) 32-bit
gcc version "4.7.3"

=FILES=
example.m: the original code you give me.
final.m: the code which use the C interface I write.
mydgetrf.c: C code to implement the dgetrf routine.
mydgetrf.mexglx: file generated from .c file which can be called from matlab.
mytrsm.c: C code to implement the trsm routine.
mytrsm.mexglx: file generated from .c file.

=RUN=
You can use "mex mydgetrf.c" to generate mydgetrf.mexglx.
The same as others.

Or you can just use the .mexglx files that I generate from .c files.

Simply you can just use the final.m to get the result.
e.g. >> final(1000);
The result contains the norm and time cost.
